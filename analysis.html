<h1>Human Activity Recognition Report</h1>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> Joshika</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  This report aims to predict the manner in which subjects performed barbell lifts using accelerometer data from wearable sensors.
  The data was collected using devices like Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit. 
  Our objective is to classify the activity quality based on the <code>classe</code> variable in the training dataset.
</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
  Devices like Jawbone Up and Fitbit are part of the quantified self movement, helping individuals monitor personal activity. 
  However, while many users measure how much they move, fewer measure how well they move. 
  In this project, data was collected from sensors placed on six individuals performing barbell lifts in five different ways.

<h2>Data Loading and Cleaning</h2>
<pre><code>
- Loaded 'pml-training.csv' and 'pml-testing.csv'
- Removed non-predictive variables: X, user_name, raw_timestamp_part_1, raw_timestamp_part_2, cvtd_timestamp, new_window, num_window
- Removed columns with >90% missing values
- Final features used for model: 53
</code></pre>

<h2>Model Training</h2>
<pre><code>
- Used caret package to build model
- Algorithm: Random Forest
- Method: 3-fold cross-validation
- Data split: 70% training / 30% validation
</code></pre>

<h2>Model Evaluation</h2>
<pre><code>
Confusion Matrix (Validation Set):
Accuracy: 0.9940
Out-of-sample error ≈ 1 - 0.9940 = 0.006 (0.6%)
</code></pre>

<h2>Justification of Model Choice</h2>
<p>
  Random Forest was selected due to its robustness, high accuracy, and ability to handle missing data and noisy variables.
  It performs internal feature selection and resists overfitting well, especially with high-dimensional datasets like ours.
</p>

<h2>Cross-validation Explanation</h2>
<p>
  We employed 3-fold cross-validation using caret’s <code>trainControl</code> to ensure the model generalizes well and avoids overfitting. 
  This approach divides the training set into three parts, trains on two, and validates on the third in rotation.
</p>

<h2>Expected Out-of-Sample Error</h2>
<pre><code>
Out-of-sample error ≈ 1 - Accuracy = 1 - 0.9940 = 0.006
</code></pre>

<h2>Submission of Predictions</h2>
<pre><code>
20 prediction files created:
- problem_id_1.txt
- problem_id_2.txt
- ...
- problem_id_20.txt

Each file contains a single prediction and is ready for upload.
</code></pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  We built a highly accurate Random Forest model to classify the quality of barbell lifts using sensor data. 
  After careful data cleaning, cross-validation, and model tuning, we achieved an estimated accuracy of 99.4%. 
  All 20 required test case predictions have been generated and saved in individual text files for submission.
